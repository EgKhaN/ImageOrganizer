# ImageOrganizer - Case Study

It reads configurations such as Count,Parallelism and SavePath from file or Data/Input.json file and download images accordingly.

I tried to keep it simple as possible because of given time.

I also have some ideas to improve my code , i can explain them in the next meeting if necessary.

Thank you for you time.
